      <p> Hi, my love.<br>
This is my way of writing a letter for you. <br>
I know the last couple of months have been hard for us, and I also know you have many things going on with university.<br>

I just want to say a few things, my life. Thank you for being in my life. <br>
I know we weren’t expecting to meet each other, but now I can say it’s the best thing that has ever happened to me.<br>

You are the sweetest, kindest, smartest, and most beautiful person. <br>
Every day I thank God for your life. <br>
I remember everything: our first kiss and the first time we held hands —<br>
those were some of the most beautiful moments of our relationship.<br>
Since the first day we thought about starting our relationship, I have been so happy.
<br>

I can no longer imagine my life without you. <br>
And I certainly cannot imagine it without<br>
 the absurd expenses, without cleaning ovens, 
 <br>and other small annoyances that, of course, 
 <br>I am willing to accept.
<br>
I look at you and reflect: long-term love is much deeper and more meaningful than the passion of a relationship’s early days. <br>
To transcend the novelty without losing desire, patience, and affection. <br>
That is what I have always wanted for my love life — to face hard times together,<br>
 to fight routine with noble arguments (but without harshness), and to respect each other’s individual freedom.<br>

I look at you and conclude: I hope you sleep by my side for the rest of my life.
      </p>
